"""Teleop episode recording during shared autonomy evaluation.

When the shared autonomy slider is at ratio=0 (pure teleop), this module
captures observation/action frames and saves them as episodes in a LeRobot
dataset.  Short segments (below a configurable threshold) are padded with
policy frames.

Teleop frames are buffered in memory and trimmed (leading/trailing no-ops
removed) before being committed to the dataset.  This avoids saving frames
where the user hasn't started pressing keys yet or has released keys before
switching out of teleop mode.

Architecture
------------
``TeleopRecordingContext`` is a singleton that bridges the policy wrapper
(which writes the current ratio) and the ``TeleopRecordingWrapper`` gym
wrapper (which reads the ratio to decide whether to record).

``TeleopRecordingWrapper`` is a standard ``gym.Wrapper`` applied to each
individual env *before* vectorisation.  It intercepts ``step`` / ``reset``
/ ``close`` and manages episode boundaries.

# Built with the Enum functional API because we want a 101-member family
# `BLEND_INTERVENTION_<pct>` alongside the 4 base values. Enumerating those
# 101 members by hand would be untenable; the comprehension below generates
# them at module load time.
#
# Members:
#   TELEOP / RRT             — "real" frames, always committed to the dataset.
#   POLICY                   — skipped, except when ratio==0 (committed for
#                              legacy callers that haven't migrated to TELEOP).
#   PADDING                  — post-teleop pad-to-min frames; committed only
#                              to reach min_episode_length.
#   BLEND_INTERVENTION_000   — controller-driven blend at ratio=0.00; committed.
#   BLEND_INTERVENTION_001   — ratio=0.01; committed.
#   ...                        (101 members total, 0..100)
#   BLEND_INTERVENTION_100   — ratio=1.00 (verbatim controller drive); committed.

# members depending on the wrapper's `forward_flow_ratio` at the time of the
